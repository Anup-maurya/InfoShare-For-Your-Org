            <p className="mb-6 font-light  text-grey-800 md:text-sm dark:text-gray-400">Take a pledge with Green Thumb, an initiative to help restore India’s depleting green coverage. Under the Green Thumb initiative, Tata Projects plants trees at its various project sites across India. These trees are attributed to the pledges of support received from participating citizens. Green Thumb is a truly unique initiative as it is led by an online `platform’ wherein the `trees’ are attributed for `clicks’ received on its microsite. People can click on the microsite – If clicks received are more than trees planted then these are attributed to the cause of protecting the environment.</p>
